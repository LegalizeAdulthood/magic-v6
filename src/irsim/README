To compile irsim run the make_irsim script.  This will compile and install
everything that's needed.

You may change the default directory (~cad) in which things get installed
by setting CAD_HOME to whatever is appropriate in your system.

The CFLAGS file contains the 2 system dependent flags.  For ultrix, hp's
and sun's you don't need to change them.  For SYSTEM-V installations set the
SYS_V flag (-DSYS_V).  If your system doesn't support sending SIGIO on sockets
(asynchronous reads) then set the NO_SIGIO (-DNO_SIGIO) flag as well, if you
are not sure about this, then set it anyhow.

For systems that do not have an X11 library, you can compile irsim without
the analyzer, for this you will have to edit the file src/irsim/Makefile
and set X=NO, and XLIB="".

The lib directory contains prm files for the scalable-cmos process.  You may
want to install these in "~cad/lib" as well.

The calibrate directory contains information on creating your own prm files.
