This is the 'utils' module.  The file 'whence.s' is an assembly language
file and is not portable.  If you are not running on a VAX or a SUN,
you can simply delete all references to 'whence' from the Makefile and
everything will be OK.  The procedures defined in 'whence.s' are only
used by the 'prleak' debugging program, which is only enabled when malloc.c
is compiled with the -DMALLOCTRACE flag.  See the cadman page on prleak(8)
for details.  Files with .mo and .mpo suffixes were compiled with the
-DMALLOCTRACE flag for use in building the libraries libmagictrace.a and
libmagictrace_p.a.

The "utils.o" file is used by magic, and contains some references to things
in other portions of Magic.  Some programs would like to use these utilities,
though, so they have been gathered into a library, libmagicutils.a.  This
library includes simple versions of the referenced Magic routines, so that the
library can be used by stand alone programs.  These simple functions appear
in the files LIBmain.c and LIBtextio.c.
